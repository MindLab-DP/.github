## Mindlab - Machine Learning, perception and discovery lab


Mindlab has been a center of excellence for Machine Learning research, teaching, theory, and practice since its founding in 2001. The research in our group is very broad, and we are interested in all aspects of machine learning. Particular strengths of the group are in multimodal learning and fusion, large scale machine learning and approachs that combine probabilistic models and deep learning.
